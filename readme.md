The master branch here is the latest updates to the Pluralsight course <b>What Is React</b>. This GitHub repo includes the final code for all the modules in the course.

## Course Description

This course will teach you what  React is, and help you  understand why React is the number one  JavaScript library for building JavaScript Apps in a browser.

In this course, What is React, you’ll learn all about the component based nature of React and how that translates into highly performant and easy to use web applications.. First, you’ll explore the nature of React and fundamentally how it addresses building component based web apps.. Next, you’ll discover more specifically how React is based on a virtual DOM that efficiently maintains the applications user interface to mirror that Virtual DOM. Finally, you’ll learn how React uses the powerful JSX syntax to represent components and the actual UI of a running web app.. When you’re finished with this course, you’ll have an excellent understanding of why  React is the most popular JavaScript library for building web apps, as well as what it takes to build a React app.

## Getting Started
1. **Install [Node 16 (latest-verson) with NPM 17](https://nodejs.org)**.
2. **Clone this repository.** - `https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-what-is-react` or [download the zip](https://github.com/pkellner/pluralsight-what-is-react/archive/master.zip)
3. **Set your default directory to which module you want (example: `cd m3-hands-on-moving-to-concurrent-rendering` - `cd m4-hands-on-with-the-new-react-hooks`
4. **Install Node Packages with Dependencies.** - `npm install`

## Directory Structure Here

Each of the folders here represent one module of the course.  In each folder, there are subfolders that represent the completed code at the end of each clip. Where this is no clip reference, either there is no code in that clip or nothing changed from the previous clip.

Once in a clip directory, the easiest way to test the app is to first install the packages by typing at the root of that directory (in a terminal window or DOS prompt)

`npm install`

Then, do run the app you just need type

`npm run dev`

That will launch the web server on port 3000 where you can browser to it at the url: `http://localhost:3000`
